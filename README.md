# GIS & Geography Projects

This repository serves as a living portfolio of my GIS, cartography, and spatial analysis work. It includes selected academic projects, personal explorations, and experiments that document my learning process and technical growth over time.

Projects here emphasize clear workflows, documentation, and practical application rather than just final results.

## Structure
Projects are organized by course and by personal work, with each project containing its own README that explains the goal, data, tools, and outcomes.

## Tools & Skills
- GIS: QGIS, ArcGIS Online
- Mapping: choropleths, classification, labeling, layout design
- Data: cleaning, joins, basic spatial analysis

## Notes
Some projects include datasets or derived outputs when permitted. When data cannot be shared, documentation and final visual outputs are provided instead.
